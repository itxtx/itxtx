## Selected Projects

- **[Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/itxtx/credit_card_fraud_prediction) & [Live Dashboard](https://itxtx.shinyapps.io/shiny_credit_app/):**  
  End-to-end anomaly detection system using XGBoost, logistic regression, autoencoders, and isolation forest. Includes advanced resampling (SMOTE, ADASYN), hyperparameter optimization (BayesSearchCV), and an interactive R Shiny dashboard for model evaluation.

- **[Solar Time Series Forecasting](https://github.com/itxtx/solar_prediction):**  
  LSTM-based prediction of solar irradiation with custom PyTorch loss functions, uncertainty quantification (Monte-Carlo Dropout), and systematic hyperparameter optimization (Optuna).

- **[Bachelor Thesis: Kernel Methods for Regression](http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:lnu:diva-126158):**  
  Comparative study of kernel regression vs. ridge regression, focusing on effects of kernel choice on test accuracy and training speed.
